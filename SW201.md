# Code Testing

Your workflow up until now was something like this:

```
loop:
  - Write new feature

  loop:
    - Open browser or/and console
    - Check in browser or/and console that your code works by trying some functionalities

      if errors
        - correct code
      else
        - exit loop
```

This is a first level of testing: manual testing. It works well if you have little code/few features in your application.

But as you add more and more functionalities in your application, it's going to be harder and harder to test manually all the possibilities.

![It can become complex](http://cdn.wonderfulengineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/gear-wallpaper-6.jpg)

That is why we want to write **automatic** tests. Automatic tests are pieces of code intended to control the validity of your application code.

It sounds like we have a recursivity problem now: what if my test code is wrong? Shoud I write test code for my test code?

![Now you are stuck](http://dreamsnest.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Snake-or-serpent-eating-its-own-tail.jpg)

It is one of the limitation of writing test code, sometimes the test code is wrong or incomplete. Writing good test is more than writing good test code, it's about testing the right things.

## Unit tests

Unit testing consist in testing individually and independently the smallest testable parts of the application (units).

![characteristics of one unit](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/_csyh21x0I5E/SNFxUXpBQoI/AAAAAAAADHs/qm4DlzV73PA/s320/Community-PUZZLE-single-PIECE.gif)

You already did manual Unit testing everytime you try your function or method in the console with different cases and it works as expected.

Typically, we want to write code to test that all the methods or functions have the expected behavior.

![unit testing is good for you](http://saltares.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/unit-test-all-the-things.png)

This way, if we make some changes somehwere and it modifies the behavior of another function or method, we will know immediatly.

An example of unit testing:

```
method foo(argument):
  - do stuff
  - return something

tests:

- expect method to receive one argument of type X
- expect method to return something if condition A
- expect method to return other_thing if condition B
```

Testing all the units of the application is a crucial step. But it's not enough...

## Integration tests

Integration testing consist in grouping and combining several units and testing the behavior of the group.

![testing a group of units](http://www.camelcitydispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/puzzle-pieces-2.jpeg)

You already did manual Integration tests everytime you opened your browser and operated several actions in order to validate a behavior.

This is much more complex than unit testing, because there could be a lot of potential combination of units.

An example of integration testing:

```
test:
1. open the browser, go to http://foo.bar
2. expect to see title "Hello to Pisano"
3. click on button X
4. expect to redirect to page A
5. fill form with email: user@email.com and password: ******
6. expect to redirect to page B
7. expect to see title "Welcome User"
```

## Test Driven Development

If we start writing some automatic tests in place of manual testing, our new workflow could like this this:

```
loop:
  - write code for new feature
  - write test code for feature

  loop:
    - launch test suite

      if any errors
        - correct code where needed
      else
        - exit loop
```

Test Driven Development (TDD) is another approach to test. The workflow looks like this:

```
loop:
  loop:
    - write test code for new feature
    - launch test suite

    if test for this feature fail
      - exit loop (it should fail)

  loop:
    - write smallest passing-test code for feature
    - lauch test suite

    if test passes
      - exit loop

  loop:
    - refactor your code for code quality
    - launch test suite

    if test passes
      - exit loop

  if feature finished
    - exit loop
```

As you can see we have 3 operations (the 3 inside loops), which are commonly called RED-GREEN-REFACTOR:

1. RED: write tests, they should fail
2. GREEN: write code, test should pass
3. REFACTOR: refactor your code, test should pass

![make it green](http://codelikethis.com/lessons/agile_development/make-it-green.png)

Here is a TDD example with tests in pseudo-code and feature code in Ruby:

**Specs**

We already have a class `Car` with some features. New feature: an instance of `Car` should be able to **start it's engine**, **stop it's engine** and inform about the **status** of it's engine.

```ruby
# 1. write test: car can receive #start_engine!
# - test fail (RED)
# - write code:

class Car

  def initialize
  end

  def start_engine!
  end
end

# - test pass (GREEN)
#   (no refactoring)
# 2. write test: after #start_engine! called, #engine_on? should be true
# - test fail
# - write code:

class Car

  def initialize
  end

  def start_engine!
  end

  def engine_on?
    true
  end
end

# - test pass
#   (no refactoring)
# 3. write test: car can receive #stop_engine!
# - test fail
# - write code:

class Car

  def initialize
  end

  def start_engine!
  end

  def stop_engine!
  end

  def engine_on?
    true
  end
end

# - test pass
#   (no refactoring)
# 4. write test: after #stop_engine! called, #engine_on? should be false
# - test fail
# - write code:

class Car

  def initialize
  end

  def start_engine!
  end

  def stop_engine!
  end

  def engine_on?
    false
  end
end

# - test 4 passes but test 2 does not pass
# - modify code:

class Car

  def initialize
    @engine_on
  end

  def start_engine!
    @engine_on = true
  end

  def stop_engine!
    @engine_on = false
  end

  def engine_on?
    @engine_on
  end
end

# - test pass
```
