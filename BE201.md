# Testing tools for Ruby and Rails

Up until now, you have beed executing tests, but not writing any. In `BE101-Exercises`, you were typing `rake` in your console to test if your code was correct. This was launching a test written by a teacher.

Now we are going to learn how to write tests for our Ruby code.

## RSpec

We are going to use [RSpec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec), the testing framework for ruby that was used in the exercises.

RSpec comes with a standard version and a [Rails version](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails), that we will use in our Rails application (we won't use Rails' integrated test framework, [Minitest](https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest)).

We will also use [factory_girl](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl_rails) to create fixtures and [shoulda-matchers](https://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda-matchers) to facilitate the tests of some common Rails functionalties.

Let's install a few gems in our Gemfile:

```ruby
# Gemfile
group :development, :test do
  gem "rspec-rails", "~> 3.4"
  gem "factory_girl_rails"
  gem "shoulda-matchers", "~> 3.0"
  gem "faker" # generate fake data
end
```

```sh
$ bundle install
$ rails generate rspec:install
```
