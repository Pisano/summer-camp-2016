# Testing tools for Ruby and Rails

Up until now, you have beed executing tests, but not writing any. In `BE101-Exercises`, you were typing `rake` in your console to test if your code was correct. This was launching a test written by a teacher.

Now we are going to learn how to write tests for our Ruby code.

## RSpec

We are going to use [RSpec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec), the testing framework for ruby that was used in the exercises.

RSpec comes with a standard version and a [Rails version](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails), that we will use in our Rails application (we won't use Rails' integrated test framework, [Minitest](https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest)).

We will also use [factory_girl](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl_rails) to create factories (mostly for our models) and [shoulda-matchers](https://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda-matchers) to facilitate the tests of some common Rails functionalties.

Let's install a few gems in our Gemfile:

```ruby
# Gemfile
group :development, :test do
  gem "rspec-rails", "~> 3.4"
  gem "factory_girl_rails"
  gem "shoulda-matchers", "~> 3.0"
  gem "faker" # generate fake data
end
```

```sh
$ bundle install
$ rails generate rspec:install
```

From now on, when you generate a new Model with `rails generate model MyModel` it will also generate a factory and a test file. You can also generate test files manually with `rails generate rspec:model MyModel`.

Test files will go in the `spec` directory and must finish by `_spec.rb`. For example a model test file for the `Post` class would be `spec/models/post_spec.rb`. Factories will go in `/spec/factories`, and the file name is the plural of the model names, for example `spec/factories/posts.rb`.

It is important to follow this convention otherwise the files won't load when the tests are lauched.

## Model Test

This is a generated Model spec file:

```ruby
# spec/models/user_spec.rb
require 'rails_helper'

RSpec.describe User, type: :model do
  pending "add some examples to (or delete) #{__FILE__}"
end
```

Spec files (RSpec test files) are ruby file with a special synthax. As you can see, the Model class tested in the file is metionned right after `RSpec.describe`, and `type: :model` describes what kind of test this file is for.

Here is a simple example of a User Model test:

```ruby
# spec/models/user_spec.rb
require 'rails_helper'

RSpec.describe User, type: :model do
  it "has a correct full name" do
    subject.first_name = "Leonardo"
    subject.last_name = "Pisano"

    expect(subject.full_name).to eq("Leonardo Pisano")
  end
end
```

A few things to learn from this small test:

- the test description goes inside a `it "does something" do [...] end` block.
- subject is an instance of the model described in `RSpec.describe Model`.
- `expect` is the test method, in this case we **expect** the call of `#full_name` on a User instance to return `"#{first_name} #{last_name}"`. If all the `expect` calls of the block return true, the test passes, otherwise it fails.

## Controller Test

A generated Controller spec file is similar to a Model spec file, it contains the controller class name after `RSpec.descibe` and `type: :controller`:

```ruby
# spec/controllers/posts_controller_spec.rb
require 'rails_helper'

RSpec.describe PostsController, type: :controller do

end
```

Here is a simple example of a PostsController Controller test:

```ruby
# spec/controllers/posts_controller_spec.rb
require 'rails_helper'

RSpec.describe PostsController, type: :controller do

  let!(:post) do
    Post.create
  end

  describe "GET #show" do
    it "returns http success" do
      get :show, params: { id: post.id }

      expect(response).to have_http_status(:success)
    end

    it "assigns the correct post in instance variable" do
      get :show, params: { id: post.id }

      expect(JSON.parse(response.body)["id"]).to eq(post.id)
    end
  end
end
```

Here we just tested a simple GET request on the `PostsController#show` method. We can see that:

- We can group tests with a `describe` block.
- an http request is done to the described controller with `word :method, params: { key: value }`
- we can test the http `response`
- In our case, the response is in JSON format, we can parse the response and test parameters.

As you can see, on top of our tests we have a `let!` block. This means we can use the variable `post` inside our tests method.

## Using Factories

Let's say that a User model has the following validations:

```ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  validates :email, presence: true
  validates :email, uniqueness: true
end
```

Now let's write a test for a `UsersController#index` method:

```ruby
# spec/controllers/users_controller_spec.rb
require 'rails_helper'

RSpec.describe UsersController, type: :controller do

  let!(:user1) do
    User.create(email: "user1@pisano.co", password:"test")
  end

  let!(:user2) do
    User.create(email: "user2@pisano.co", password:"test")
  end

  describe "GET #index" do
    it "render all the users" do
      get :index

      resp = JSON.parse(response.body)
      expect(resp.map{ |r| r["id"] }).to include(user1.id, user2.id)
    end
  end
end
```

Everytime we need a user, we need to declare it with all it's required attributes. It can quickly be complicated. So we will use factories:

```ruby
# spec/factories/users
FactoryGirl.define do
  factory :user do
    email    { Faker::Internet.email }
    password { "password" }
  end
end
```

And now we can use our new factory in our test file:

```ruby
# spec/controllers/users_controller_spec.rb
require 'rails_helper'

RSpec.describe UsersController, type: :controller do

  let!(:user1) do
    FactoryGirl.create(:user)
  end

  let!(:user2) do
    FactoryGirl.create(:user)
  end

  describe "GET #index" do
    it "render all the users" do
      get :index

      resp = JSON.parse(response.body)
      expect(resp.map{ |r| r["id"] }).to include(user1.id, user2.id)
    end
  end
end
```

We can also override the Model's attributes if we want:

```ruby
# [...]
FactoryGirl.create(:user, email: "explicit@pisano.co")
```

## Shoulda Matchers

Shoulda matchers help us test some common Rails functionalties. In the Model spec files, we can add:

```ruby
# spec/models/user_spec.rb
# [...]
RSpec.describe User, type: :model do

  it { should validate_presence_of(:email) }
  it { should validate_uniqueness_of(:email) }
  # [...]
end
```

```ruby
# spec/models/post_spec.rb
# [...]
RSpec.describe Post, type: :model do
  it { should have_many(:comments) }
  # [...]
end
```

```ruby
# spec/models/comment_spec.rb
# [...]
RSpec.describe Comment, type: :model do

  it { should belong_to(:post) }
  # [...]
end
```
