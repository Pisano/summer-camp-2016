# Specs

The goal of this exercise is to build a new application whose goal is to create and publish fantasy sports teams.

## Part 1

After creating a new application, we will have to implement 2 models:

- teams
- players

A Team has many players, players are in only one team.

A visitor must be able to:

- see all teams, create new team, edit team, delete team
- See all the players.
- For an existing team, create a new player.
