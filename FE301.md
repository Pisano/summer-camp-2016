  application.

### Introduction


As we saw in last weeks, a web application comes together with the utilization of many different
technologies.

Today we'll look into one solution for the upper parts of the stack.

Let's quickly define what is and what contitutes a frontend development. 

Being the part the user directly interacts, it has some esthetic concerns. mainly addressed by the
ui/ux designers. with which we should not concern ourselves. which in turn gets limited with the
technology at hand, like the colors you're able to display, the positioning of elements for a
maintainable implementation. which we also should not concern ourselves, as today's technologies
provide lots of freedom. The development process then becomes an implementation of a certain design
idea comprising of elements and their functionalities.

In the last weeks we've already practiced the basics of the individual technologies (e.g. html, css
and js) which asbtracts certain technicalities for the implementation. As you might have realised,
though they are useful, most of the time they are old and clumsy. and most disadvantageously, they
lack guidance to write good applications. What does it mean for an application to be good, is mostly
about opinion, it doesn't have strict criterias. but over the years, people accumulated enough
experience to build principles that can help you write better applications. So while writing your
applications is in one part about using certain technologies, it is also about incorporating ideas
and pricinciples which is not enforced by any technicalities but drawn from experience.

<!--
I should have touched on importance of constraints
Maybe a quote is enough

"Constraints foster creativity"
-->


So today's lecture is about one aproach to the problem of principled application development. It has
been drawn from experience of some highly talented people and adopted by many more. Once these
highly talented people accumulate enough principles and code for what they consider as a proper base
of application development, being nice people, they share it. And this in turn gets called a
framework.

So a framework is a set of principles capturing certain patterns of development in the aim of
helping with many aspects of a development process like developer productivity, team communication,
code structure, module discovery and code sharing.

So, this is the conceptual framework i would like to present this lecture, i'll try going over
certain principles and their correspondening implementations in the framework. Since these are not
machine checked rules, like the syntax of js or html, but much more abstract in the sense that they
are built on top of the technologies but they are worthy of consideration on their own rights, i
find this the best approach for the continuous evolution of these ideas.

But first, we need to set up an environment.

Webpack
===

As javascript has to run on many different browsers, it is really hard to keep it fresh. To be able
to use a new feature all the browsers has to implement it. Or we can try another approach.
Implementing new features on top of the existing ones.

To start, javascript does not have a module system for separating your application into multiple
files. If you have more than one file you have to make sure that they are loaded into the page and
loaded in correct order.

```html
<html>
  <head>
    ...
  </head>
  <body>
    ...
    <script src="script1.js"></script>
    <script src="script2.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

This gets pretty messy pretty quickly, and it adds a bias against splitting your application.
Which is bad, and is the primary problem webpack tries to solve.

With webpack, we can do this:

```js
# content.js
module.exports = 'it works!';
```

```js
# entry.js
var content = require('./content.js')
document.write(content);
```

Webpack produces a `bundle.js` file that is just a plain javascript file, which you can include with
a script tag just like before.

Webpack also has a developer server, which keeps you from refreshing the page everytime you change
the source along with other improvements to our workflow, which we can discover as we go.

### Installing webpack

```
$ npm install -g webpack
```

### Creating a playground

```js
// webpack.config.js
module.exports = {
  entry: "./entry.js",
  output: {
    path: __dirname,
    filename: "bundle.js"
  }
}
```

```js
// entry.js
var content = "it works";
document.write(content);
```

```html
// index.html
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
  </head>
  <body>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="bundle.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

This is all we need for the skeleton of our application. We have one file for configuring webpack
which essentially states, our main application file is `entry.js`, start from there; the output
should go into `bundle.js` file, which should be in the current directory kept in the special nodejs
variable `__dirname`. That variable can be considered magic for now, rest is pretty simple.

Running `webpack` on this folder should produce a bundle.js file. let's try it

```
$ webpack
Hash: 7f65cedf0a84b12b7132
Version: webpack 1.13.1
Time: 51ms
    Asset     Size  Chunks             Chunk Names
bundle.js  1.44 kB       0  [emitted]  main
   [0] ./entry.js 52 bytes {0} [built]
```

Let's open `index.html` referencing our `bundle.js` file to see if it works.

Trying out the modules.

```js
// content.js
module.exports = "it works from content.js";
```

```js
// entry.js
var content = require("./content.js");
document.write(content);
```

This time, `index.html` should be showing what we wrote in `content.js`. neat, yes?

### Dev Server

Right now only help we get from webpack is the `require` function. We write our application in a
tree like structure of files, one file acting as the root and eventually requiring all the others
necessary. If we change any of these files, we need to run `webpack` command and it will collect
every file that is in the transitive dependency list of the `entry.js` file we specified in
`webpack.config.js` file for, as the name suggests, webpack configuration.

Webpack has another module called `webpack-dev-server`. Let's install it and see what it does.

```
$ npm install -g webpack-dev-server
```

Right now if we run `webpack-dev-server` instead of `webpack` in the folder containing
webpack.config.js, it should print something similar to this:

```
  0% compile
http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/
webpack result is served from /
content is served from /Users/ibrahims/pisano-summer-camp/fe301/webpack-folder
Hash: 8c8543f1b6adabc5f473
Version: webpack 1.13.1
Time: 85ms
    Asset     Size  Chunks             Chunk Names
bundle.js  1.57 kB       0  [emitted]  main
chunk    {0} bundle.js (main) 109 bytes [rendered]
    [0] ./entry.js 64 bytes {0} [built]
    [1] ./content.js 45 bytes {0} [built]
webpack: bundle is now VALID.
```

We have 5 extra lines here, first 4 and the last one. which says, you can visit
`http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/` and you have a valid bundle now.

if you visit the page, it should have an extra bar at the top of the page and our `it works`
message.

That's enough setup, main advantage of this new server of ours is whenever we change one of the
source files, it will refresh the page automatically. You may never get to appreciate how much time
it saves us, but it really does.

### A simple gadget.

Before diving into angular i would like to explain what i mean by a principle with a toy example. In
this case, we'll try implementing a clock.

```JS
seconds = new Date().getTime() / 1000
document.write(Math.floor(seconds/3600)%24 + ":" + Math.floor(seconds/60) % 60 + ":" + (seconds%60));
```

```
Side note:
Epoch is a point in time, in this case january 1st 1970, that computers use to synchronize time. and
`new Date().getTime()` expression gives us a number which my computer thinks the number of
miliseconds passed since epoch. everytime i use that expression i get a number, which i can use to
display the clock, there are many more utilities to display time, but this is the simplest one and
we'll use that for demonstration purposes.
```

See how ugly that is? why is that? can we even define ugliness?

Ugliness is a big messy thing largely based on opinion. Here i'll give my own opinion. In the end,
I hope, you'll come to appreciate the reasons behind.

Ugliness is attributed to programs that lacks readability.

```
Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.
```

Even though the above code works, I mean, it prints the clock on the page when the page first loads,
It is not obvious what it does if you're seeing it for the first time. In this case it was written
to solve a problem, but without any consideration for people who has to read and modify it later,
and it is almost impossible to compose this piece of code with other code, or reuse it in somewhere
else. As the application grows with more and more functionality, if we don't pay attention to
certain details it will be a big pile of mess no one can touch.

Enough philosophy, let's see what we can do to make it more readable. The main problems seems to be
we are trying to do too many calculations at once and the mathmetical operators lost their semantics.
giving names to calculated values can take us a long way. let's try naming three parts of our clock,
`display_hours`, `display_minutes` and `display_seconds`.

```JS
seconds = new Date().getTime() / 1000;
display_seconds = seconds % 60;
display_minutes = Math.floor(seconds / 60) % 60;
display_hours   = Math.floor(seconds / 3600) % 24;
document.write(display_hours + ":" + display_minutes + ":" + display_seconds)
```

We can consider that much more readable. Let's go a step further and try to bring some of the
semantics of these calculations in to code so our intentions are more clear for the next people who
reads it. Assigning names to sub expressions can help us again.

```JS
epoch_seconds = new Date().getTime() / 1000;
epoch_minutes = Math.floor(epoch_seconds / 60);
epoch_hours = Math.floor(epoch_minutes / 60);

display_seconds = epoch_seconds % 60;
display_minutes = epoch_minutes % 60;
display_hours   = epoch_hours   % 24;

document.write(display_hours + ":" + display_minutes + ":" + display_seconds)
```

Introducing `epoch_minutes` and `epoch_hours` for number of minutes and hours passed since epoch,
our logic becomes much more clear and we get rid of that 3600 hiding two steps of the calculation.

Let's go a step further and name the whole procedure, using a function definition.

```JS
function get_clock(miliseconds) {
  epoch_seconds = miliseconds / 1000;
  epoch_minutes = Math.floor(epoch_seconds / 60);
  epoch_hours = Math.floor(epoch_minutes / 60);

  display_seconds = epoch_seconds % 60;
  display_minutes = epoch_minutes % 60;
  display_hours   = epoch_hours   % 24;

  display_clock = display_hours + ":" + display_minutes + ":" + display_seconds;
  return display_clock;
}

miliseconds = new Date().getTime();
document.write(get_clock(miliseconds));
```

Even though this code has it's own deficiencies. We have come a long way in terms of readability.
Possible improvements would be to separate how we display the time, maybe we want to change ':' with
a '-' and all sorts of things, but we definitely get some benefits for abstracting the procedure in
to a function that turns number of miliseconds since an epoch to a clock for display.


```JS
setInterval(function() {
  miliseconds = new Date().getTime();
  document.querySelector('body').innerHTML = get_clock(miliseconds);
}, 1000);
```

Now, the clock updates itself every second without we having to change anything about how to display it.

Even though this is just a toy example, we get to see some of the advantages of putting some thought
into how we structure our code. These come together with lots of benefits once our application
reach hundreds of small functionalities like this simple clock and we have other developers trying
to make changes to same codebase. 

### Principles of a framework

There can be much more, but i'd like to emphasize the following principles for a maintainable and
scalable application.

- separation of concerns
- modularity
- abstraction
- consistency

The first principle, separation of concerns, is like the most fundamental one. We can see it in
every practice civilized humans occupy themselves. It becomes especially apparent in engineering
disciplines. For example, the functionality and esthetics of a building is considered by an
architect in their own terms and developed with their own tools. While the structural and physical
requirements are mostly the responsibility of a civil engineer, while the operation and execution of
actually building the structure is a whole different story left to yet other people. And this all
happens within a frame that governs each individual participating in the whole process. And, in a
much smaller scale, our clock example shows how we decided to split the calculation of epoch values
and their corresponding display values, but lacking a glue to put these pieces together, we ended up
putting everything into one function, which violates our next principle, modularity.

Modularity can be considered a specialization of separation of concerns, for example, if we had
developed our clock example with somehow different modules that each concern themselves with a
separate part of the logic, like displaying the values and the calculation of these values other
than locality of statements, we would have gotten a modular application. Angular provides a lot of
infrastructure for writing modules. We'll get to know them soon.

Modularity also allows us to share our code within the project, and maybe on different projects.
Angular comes with a lot of modules, using their own module infrastructre, making the mundande tasks
like talking to an api much easier.

Abstraction is the cornerstone of pretty much anything we do, from a desk to a space shuttle.
Everything that simplifies our life by separating a process from a behaviour, what is happenning
from how it is happening is an abstraction. Our way of getting the milliseconds since an epoch can
be considered an abstraciton. The operating can be keeping an internal clock and incrementing it in
regular intervals to provide the value when we need it, it might also be getting it from a
different computer on the network, or we might have an atomic clock for precise timing connected to
computer. It might even be getting the time from a metaphysical channel from gods for all you care.
But none of that concerns us. In that sense, it is another specialization of separation of concerns
principle.

Our way of constructing computing a clock string can be considered another abstraction.
Albeit a much weaker one, it allows us to hide some of the details. The procedure defined for the
function could have been the ugly code that we started with or the much more readable one we
reached. The users of the `get_clock` function do not have to care.

We've also seen this in action in our internet infrastructure, there was layers of abstraction that
each concerned themselves with one aspect of network communication, leaving one less thing to worry
about for the layer above.

Consistency is a more cross cutting concern. If you can be consistent in your solutions, you can
familiarize yourself with a new application or a new module within an application much more easily.
It also allows you to share code with other people. And this is one of the most important benefits
of using an established and widely adopted framework. Even though you can create much of the
functionality angular provides yourself, they are costly, it takes will and effort to incorporate
these principles in your application. And there are absolutely tens or hundreds of different ways
to do something. The problem then becomes how can you share these principles with other people,
Because applications of principles appear over time with experience, it's clear that having a common
ground for different people to contribute is beneficial. Even though learning a framework is a lot
of effort it pays for itself in the long term. Consider it like getting a year of experience by
practicing a framework for a month. Not only that, because you are already standing in the shoulders
of giants, you get to benefit from each successive improvement of the framework automatically.

In that sense a framework is a concrete embodiment of these abstract ideas. Having a parallel to
these ideas will allow you to get more insight, draw parallels between different frameworks, learn
them more quickly and bend the rules when necessary.
