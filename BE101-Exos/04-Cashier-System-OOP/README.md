# Background

How was `03-Cashier-System`? Do you feel like your program is a little bit of a mess? If yes, don't worry. We are now going to use the power of Object Oriented programming to implement **Single responsibility principle (SRP)** and have a much nicer code with re-usable pieces.

# Specs

Re-write your program from `03-Cashier-System` but this time use Object Oriented programming.

The reduction rules stay the same.

You are given the starting point: the `app.rb` file is just supposed to launch your app and include as little code as possible. The `shop.rb` contain your first class.

### How to start?

Before coding, start to think about what objects you will need. How are these objects going to be related to each other? Don't hesitate to draw diagrams on paper if it helps you.

# Test

when you think you are good, type `rake` in your terminal, all tests must be green. Ideally you should not have any style offense.
