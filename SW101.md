## World wide web

Global network of computers or The Internet works in a way that is, as you might imagine,
combination and interconnection of many different components. 

![functions of world wide web][www_functions]

Today, we're going to talk about network and the internet parts. And how they provide the
infrastructure for the higher levels.


## Network layers

The Network mainly works in a way that's layered.

### A Cautinary tale.
"EVERYTHING WE DO ONLINE WE DO WITH SOME KIND OF METAPHOR"

- cyberspace
- internet superhighways
- infobahns
- global villages
- coffee houses with a thousand rooms
- town squares
- freshman lookbooks
- cloud

Since the information is mostly formless, we use metaphors. And like all metaphors, 
metaphors for the internet is there to explain one or more aspects of the whole.
But definitely not the whole. So i would advise you to keep tabs on the metaphors being used and try
and look at the underlying system, sooner or later they will come short, and you'll be alone to
tie the ends.

### An Analogy

To illustrate the importance, implications, costs and benefits of the layered architecture. 
We'll use an anology of physical mail transportation to go over the stack, again, there is no one
to one correspondence between one and the other. This is not even the best example, and should not
be extended beyond there.

The city
- The roads, highways, streets. may be a better correspondence.
Delivery drivers
- Provides end to end delivery
Transport company
- keeps track of the packet and makes sure it is not lost between transportation paths.
People buying and selling stuff online
- They are the end users of this infrastructure.


### Benefits

The main goal here is abstraction. When you use abstractions, you get to stay away from most of the
details. Like, you don't care if a driver is not able to come to work that day, the transport
company has a lot employees that can do the job. Furthermore, this liberation from the details,
help you communicate in a more effective manner. In this case, when you are talking about sending
mail, even if the person you are talking to doesn't know anything about sending mail, you can use
the simple terms of the transport company.

So if it's build to keep you away from details, why do you have to know that it exists?

Once in a while, you hit the limits. Referring it in more precise terms other than magic, is
helpfull for precise communication and choosing among alternatives. For example:

- You know that it's cheaper to send a piece of paper as a `document`(in transport company's
terms).
- You buy a plan ticket if you want to get somewhere faster.
- You try not to order food in rush hour, as the courier will get stuck on the traffic and your
dinner will get cold.



## Protocols

### IP

This is the layer that provides you with computer to computer communication.
But it leaves you with a physical adress.

```
You can enter these addresses in your browser

216.58.209.174 -- to access google.com
178.62.200.105 -- for pisano.co
```

which you can't remember for every place you want to visit
online.

### DNS

That's where DNS comes in. Standing for Domain Name System. It translates domain names to the
physical address of the machine hosting the website/application you intend to access.

Think of it as a very big phone book.

```
google.com -> 216.58.209.174
pisano.co  -> 178.62.200.105
...
```

This has couple levels of indirection. What you need to know is, when you buy a domain name, you
register a name server with your domain provider. Name Server, once queried with a domain name,
returns the actual physical adress.

### UDP

This is a simple layer on top of the ip layer. It provides the ability for multiple applications to
share a host computer. Other than that, UDP is so simple it's best understood by what it lacks from
TCP. Sometimes this can be its power. Simple is fast for example.


### TCP

This is the Protocol that powers most of the higher level protocols. Basically, if you're not
transmitting 100s of megabytes of video in realtime, you use TCP.

TCP Provides:
- Ordered Data
- Reliable Transmission
- Flow Control
- Congestion Control

For example, you can send messages that wouldn't fit in one ip packet. And tcp makes sure they would
get the destination. and get there in the correct order. Also it can try to adjust the pressure on
the network, so that the network doesn't go down once too many people connect it.

### Examples

Here is couple of examples. It's not expected of you to understand them in great detail. They are
meant as an introduction to common terminology in network programming. 

First, we have servers, which is the component that sits there and waits for incoming connections.
Then, we have clients, which is the party that initiates the connection with a listening server.
And the communication between this two parties happen through sockets.

The lifecycle of this sockets is basically, creation, interaction and closing. Each of these is handled
with different events. And you react to events. How you react to it can be complicated. Hence, we'll
starts with a simple echo server.


#### Echo Server
```js
// Load the TCP Library
const net = require('net');

// pick a port to connect to
const PORT = 3333

// Handle connecting sockets
function connectionHandler(socket) {
  // Identify this client
  socket.name = socket.remoteAddress + ":" + socket.remotePort;

  // Send a nice welcome message and announce
  socket.write("Welcome " + socket.name + "\n");

  // Handle incoming messages from clients.
  socket.on('data', (data) => {
    socket.write(data)
    process.stdout.write(socket.name + "> " + data.toString() + "\n");
  });

  // write to the console, if we encounter an error.
  socket.on('error', (error) => {
    process.stdout.write(socket.name + " throws " + error.toString() + "\n");
  });

  // write to the console, if we encounter an error.
  socket.on('end', () => {
    process.stdout.write(socket.name + " disconnected.\n");
  });
}

// Start a TCP Server
const server = net.createServer(connectionHandler)
server.listen(PORT);

process.stdout.write("Echo server running at port " + PORT + "\n");
```

We can use the `telnet <server_ip> <server_port>` to interact with this server. in this case:

```shell
$ telnet localhost 3333
```

or we can write our own client:

```js
// utilities
const _ = require('lodash');

// same tcp library that we used to create the server
const net = require('net');

// utility for reading the lines user types.
const readline = require('readline');

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3333;
const HOST = process.env.HOST || 'localhost';

// SETUP the interactions
// we specify we want to read lines from the terminal.
const rl = readline.createInterface({
  input: process.stdin,
  output: process.stdout
})

// SETUP the connection socket.
var socket = new net.Socket();

// Socket can read data.
socket.on('data', (data) => {
  process.stdout.write(data.toString() + '\n');
});

// Socket can emit errors.
socket.on('error', (error) => {
  process.stdout.write(error.toString() + '\n');
});

// Socket can be closed by the server
socket.on('close', () => {
  rl.close();
  socket.destroy();
  process.stdout.write('Connection closed');
});

// Finally, connect to the server.
socket.connect(PORT, HOST, () => {
  console.log('Connected');
});

// connect the terminal to the socket.
rl.on('line', (input) => {
  socket.write(input + '\n');
});
```

#### Chat server

We can extend our echo server to keep a list of connected clients. At this point it turns into a
chat server.

```js
const _ = require('lodash');

// Load the TCP Library
const net = require('net');

// pick a port to connect to
const PORT = 3333

// Keep track of the chat clients
const state = {
  'clients': []
};

// send a message to all connected clients except one who sends it.
function broadcast(message, sender) {
  const socketsToWrite = _.reject(state.clients, ['name', sender.name])
  _.forEach(socketsToWrite, (socket) => {
    socket.write(message);
  });
  process.stdout.write(message + "\n");
}

// Handle connecting sockets
function connectionHandler(socket) {

  // Identify this client
  socket.name = socket.remoteAddress + ":" + socket.remotePort;

  // Put this new client in our list.
  state.clients = _.concat(state.clients, socket);

  // Send a nice welcome message and announce
  socket.write("Welcome " + socket.name + "\n");
  // Notify everyone else connected.
  broadcast(socket.name + " joined the chat\n", socket);

  // Handle incoming messages from clients.
  socket.on('data', (data) => {
    message = data.toString();
    // we have one little command that specifies the intention to exit out of the chat room.
    if (message.startsWith('quit')) {
      state.clients = _.reject(state.clients, ['name', socket.name]);
      socket.end();
      return;
    }
    broadcast(socket.name + "> " + message, socket);
  });

  socket.on('end', () => {
    // if the connection ends, we remove the client from our list of connected clients.
    state.clients = _.reject(state.clients, ['name', socket.name]);
    // Notify everyone else connected.
    broadcast(socket.name + " left the chat.\n", socket);
  });

  // log what just happened.
  socket.on('error', (error) => {
    process.stdout.write(socket.name + " throws " + error.toString() + "\n");
  });
} // connectionHandler

// Start a TCP Server
const server = net.createServer(connectionHandler)
server.listen(PORT);

console.log("Chat server running at port " + PORT + "\n");
```

## Web

At this point that is just a high level overview of the components of the internet.
This is the infrastructure, that supports many many applications. Bitcoin, Torrent, Financial services,
Internet of things, Your coffee machine set to be controlled from your watch, Mail Servers, Some
medical device designed to monitor your hearth rate. They all use the internet. We will ignore all
of them and focus on what constitutes World Wide Web.

### A bit of a history

Around 1992 a scientist at CERN labrotories realizes that internet is pretty amazing and it can be
used to distributet scientific knowledge. So it sets himself a pretty home page with bunch of links
to other pages containing the actual scientific papers. and from that pages there are other links to
other pages and so on. Since these pages consist of text and some additional presentation material,
for example headers, images, more images, animated images; they decide to call it Hyper Text.

The transfer protocol for these documents gets called HTTP(Hyper Text Transfer Protocol).

Since this hyper text contains presentational material other than text. like headers and images.
sharing one big document. people start marking different parts of the document with special words
between angular brackets `<` `>`. And this gets called HTML(Hyper Text Markup Language).

```html
<h1>This is a top level header<h1>
<h4>This is a smaller header<h4>
<a href="wikipedia.org">link to wikipedia<a>
<img src="pisano.co/logo.png" />
```

Then, to be able to personalize the pages further comes Style Sheets. 

```css
h1 {
  font-size: 30pt;
}
```

and, to add interactivity to these pages, comes a programming language JavaScript.

```html
<span onclick="alert('you clicked me!')">click me</span>
```

So like our previous echo and chat example, we need two parties for this communication. One client
and one server. In this case, clients are called web browsers; servers are called web
servers. They communicate through this protocol called http.


### HTTP

So, since http is built on top of tcp, we can still use our tools.

If we run our `client.js` script using `HOST=www.google.com.tr PORT=80 node client.js` 

in this case we can speak the most simple words. extra line at the end is important.

```http
GET / HTTP/1.1
HOST: www.google.com.tr

```

google in this case will respond to us with the following.

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Wed, 29 Jun 2016 11:01:27 GMT
... more headers ...

8000
<!doctype html>.....
```

Most of the time, that's the underlying communication pattern between your browser and the google's
web servers. or any other website.

Remember, HTTP is, at first, designed as a document sharing protocol. So this `GET /` part of the
message means i want to `get` the document at the `/`.

Changing that `GET` word, notating a `HTTP Method`, to `POST` allows us to pass extra data from
client to server. which is the message produced by your browser when you fill a form on a web page.

```http
POST /login HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 27

username=user&password=pass
```

And this form functionality is the next missing part for a lot of web applications.

I would advise you to install [httpie](https://github.com/jkbrzt/httpie) and play around with it.
especially after the Web APIs lecture. Watch what goes on inside the messages.


### Conclusion

It is a lot to digest. The main takeaway should be that Web is a complex structure with
layers and layers of components. Somehow, we need to navigate not just within a layer but up
and down the ladder of abstraction to build the products end users will love. And learn to structure
our own applications in a way that creates imperfect but friendly abstractions.
