# Web Services and Goodies

Web software today is mostly APIs talking to other APIs. There is a lot of services out there, so how do you know when to build your own solution and when to use an existing service or product?

As a rule of thumb, you try to focus on building your core business' specific features, and you use other services and product for what is not your core business.

You can read [this interesting article](https://baremetrics.com/blog/build-it-buy-it) about this question of building versus buying.

Here are a few examples of services you probably don't want to build yourself (unless, again, it's your core business to provide this service):

- Hosting your application
- Sending emails
- Hosting your application's users' content (images, other files)
- Sending sms
- Sending messages to other apps (like Slack)
- Receiving money from your users and any other money transfer
- Any kind of monitoring your application

Let's look at how to implement a few services in our Rails application:

## Hosting and deployment

### PostgreSQL

It's about time we change Database. So far we have been using SQLite3 (you may not have mentioned). We will now use PostgreSQL which integrates well with Rails.

This is how you create a new app with a Postgres database:

```sh
$ rails new my_pg_app_name --database=postgresql # you can add -T for no tests
```

If you look at the Gemfile, you will see that it has a `gem 'pg'` instead of `gem 'sqlite3'`.

### Puma server and Heroku's rails_12factor

We need to add some gems to our application for production mode:

```ruby
# Gemfile
ruby '2.3.1' # add your ruby version, type ruby -v in the console to know it

group :production do
  gem 'rails_12factor'
  gem 'puma'
end
```

```sh
$ bundle install
```

Then add this line to the `Procfile file:

```
web: bundle exec puma -C config/puma.rb
```

And finaly configure puma this way:

```ruby
# config/puma.rb
workers Integer(ENV['WEB_CONCURRENCY'] || 1)
threads_count = Integer(ENV['MAX_THREADS'] || 5)
threads threads_count, threads_count

preload_app!

rackup      DefaultRackup
port        ENV['PORT']     || 3000
environment ENV['RACK_ENV'] || 'development'

on_worker_boot do
  # Worker specific setup for Rails 4.1+
  # See: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/deploying-rails-applications-with-the-puma-web-server#on-worker-boot
  ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection
end
```

### Heroku

We are going to deploy to Heroku, because it's dead simple and does not require system administrator skills. Go to [https://signup.heroku.com/](https://signup.heroku.com/) and create an account. Creating an account is free, and they offer a Free plan that has a lot of limitations, but is going to be good enough for exercises.

Install on OS X:

```sh
$ brew install heroku
```

Install on Ubuntu:

```sh
$ wget -qO- https://toolbelt.heroku.com/install-ubuntu.sh | sh
```

Now login to your heroku account from the terminal, from your application's directory:

```sh
$ heroku login
```

Create a new heroku app:

```sh
heroku create my_app_on_heroku --region eu
```

This just created a new git remote. Now we can push/pull our code from two sources: github and heroku. This will make deployement super easy, you just have to push your master to heroku:

```sh
$ git push heroku master
```

You can also run commands on heroku like:

```sh
$ heroku run rake db:migrate # or other db rake tasks
$ heroku run rails c # open the rails console with heroku app loaded
$ heroku open # open the app in your browser
$ heroku logs --tail # show the app log and keep listening
```

## Mailing

Rails integrates some mailing functionalites that are helpful for transactional email. For marketing email, please use a service like mailchimp that allow users to unsubscribe and modify their preferences.

Let's implement a welcome email when a user registers to our blog:

```sh
$ rails generate mailer UserMailer welcome
#      create  app/mailers/user_mailer.rb
#      invoke  erb
#      create    app/views/user_mailer
#      create    app/views/user_mailer/welcome.text.erb
#      create    app/views/user_mailer/welcome.html.erb
```

First, enter the email you want to send from in ApplicationMailer:

```ruby
class ApplicationMailer < ActionMailer::Base
  default from: 'your-blog-email@pisano.co'
  layout 'mailer'
end
```

Now let's implement `UserMailer#welcome`. It works in a similar way than a controller in the sense that it will render an HTML view that has the same name as the method. And the instance variables are available in the view:

```ruby
# app/mailers/user_mailer.rb
class UserMailer < ApplicationMailer
  def welcome(user)
    @user = user

    mail(to: @user.email, subject: 'Welcome to Pisano')
    # Will render app/views/user_mailer/welcome.html.erb
    #         and app/views/user_mailer/welcome.text.erb
  end
end
```

We can now define the email content by implementing the views. It's important to implement both the HTML and the text version for email clients who dont' support HTML emails:

```erb
<!-- app/views/user_mailer/welcome.html.erb -->

<p><strong>Hi <%= @user.name %>,</strong></p>

<p>Welcome to Pisano, you can start blogging.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>
```

```erb
<!-- app/views/user_mailer/welcome.text.erb -->

Hi <%= @user.name %>,

Welcome to Pisano, you can start blogging.

Cheers!
```

:warning: HTML in email does not always react like web HTML. Be careful.

Now we can add the email delivery in our controller:

```ruby
# app/controllers/users/registrations_controller.rg
class Users::RegistrationsController < ApplicationController
  def create
    @user = User.new(user_params)

    if @user.save
      UserMailer.welcome(@user).deliver_now
      #[...]
    end
  end
end
```

You can also call `UserMailer` from the rails console.

### Development mode

In development mode, we don't really send emails. We will use a gem that will fake the sending of an email, `letter_opener`. It will open a new tab in the browser with the email.

```ruby
# Gemfile
group :development do
  # [...]
  gem "letter_opener"
end
```

```sh
$ bundle install
```

```ruby
# config/environments/development.rb
Rails.application.configure do
  # [...]
  config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :letter_opener
  config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { host: "localhost:3000" }
end
```

### Production mode

#### Sendgrid on Heroku

In production mode, we need to use a mailing service. Sendgrid is one of them, they have an heroku integration that allows to send up to 12000 emails per month for free.

Add Sendgrid with the heroku toolbelt:

```sh
$ heroku addons:create sendgrid:starter
```

Open Sendgrid in your browser:

```sh
$ heroku addons:open sendgrid
```

A popup window will appear to ask for email confirmation, confirm your email.

In your app, configure your parameters:

```ruby
# config/application.rb
class Application < Rails::Application
  # [...]
  config.action_mailer.smtp_settings = {
    :address        => 'smtp.sendgrid.net',
    :port           => '587',
    :authentication => :plain,
    :user_name      => ENV['SENDGRID_USERNAME'],
    :password       => ENV['SENDGRID_PASSWORD'],
    :domain         => 'heroku.com',
    :enable_starttls_auto => true
  }
end
```

```ruby
# config/environments/production.rb
Rails.application.configure do
  # [...]
  config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :smtp
  config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { host: 'my_app.herokuapp.com' }
end
```

## Storing User assets in the Cloud

If our application allows user to upload files (like their profile picture, or any other file), we will need to to store it somewhere. We can't store it on heroku with our app, because heroku dyno's file system is [ephemeral](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/dynos#ephemeral-filesystem).

### Figaro

Before we start: As we are using an external service, we will communicate with it via their API. We will need to authenticate to this API with an API key (a token), that must remain secret. We especially don't want this key to be on Github ([read horor story](http://vertis.io/2013/12/16/unauthorised-litecoin-mining.html)).

Let's install the Figaro gem that will help us keep our API keys safe:

```ruby
# Gemfile
gem 'figaro'
```

```sh
$ bundle install
$ bundle binstubs figaro
$ figaro install
$ spring stop
```

It will generate a file in `config/application.yml`. Make sur this file is in `.gitignore`.

### Amazon S3

We are going to use Amazon Web Services (AWS) and their S3 service. AWS is free for one year, and then it is very cheap.

Create a AWS account or login with your Amazon account: [https://aws.amazon.com/](https://aws.amazon.com/). You will need to give your credit card number and do a phone validation process (give your correct phone number).

Now go to S3, create a new Bucket (Choose location to be as close as possible from your users). A bucket is a folder (not really but let's pretend) that will include the files for our application.

#### Security

In order to avoid loosing thousands of dollars overnight, let's secure our bucket:

- Go to [https://aws.amazon.com/iam/)](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/) and enter the console (on the right).
- On the left, go to Users and create a new User (same name as the bucket you just created). **You need to have one user per rails application** for better security.
- Click on `Download Credentials` button
- Go to your new user => Permissions => Inline Policies => create new => Custom policy
- Write the name as the bucket name and copy this code in Policy Document. Don't forget to replace `YOUR_BUCKET_NAME` with your bucket name:

```json
{
  "Statement": [{
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:ListAllMyBuckets",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::*"
    }, {
      "Action": "s3:*",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET_NAME",
        "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET_NAME/*"
      ]
  }]
}
```

- Make sure that the file `.gitignore` contains the line `config/application.yml` (otherwise your keys will be on Github and any crawling robot can get them very quickly) and add this to `config/application.yml` with your values:

```yaml
# config/application.yml
AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME: "your_bucket_name"
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: "AK****************"
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: "DaaEL0xj8J****************"
```

- if you work with other people on the application, you will have to give them those keys (not through the internet ideally).

This will work well in development mode, but in production, we need to inform heroku about our api keys (remember the `.gitignore` file, `application.yml` won't be pushed to heroku either):

```sh
$ figaro heroku:set -e production
```

You can check if it works:

```sh
$ heroku config
```

#### Paperclip

[Paperclip](https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip#) is a file attachement gem for ActiveRecord. It will allow us to upload files associated with Models.

Add it to your Gemfile along the AWS gem:

```ruby
# Gemfile
gem 'aws-sdk', '< 2.0'
gem 'paperclip'
```

```sh
$ bundle install
```

Create a new initializer:

```ruby
# config/initializers/paperclip.rb
Paperclip::Attachment.default_options[:storage] = :s3
Paperclip::Attachment.default_options[:url] = ':s3_domain_url'
Paperclip::Attachment.default_options[:path] = '/:rails_env/:class/:attachment/:id_partition/:style/:filename'
Paperclip::Attachment.default_options[:s3_credentials] = {
  bucket:             ENV['AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME'],    # \
  access_key_id:      ENV['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'],     #  |- DO NOT replace this
  secret_access_key:  ENV['AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY']  # /
}
```

Now let's add an `:avatar` attribute to our User model with this new generator:

```sh
$ rails generate paperclip user avatar
$ rake db:migrate
```

Your migration should look like this:

```ruby
class AddAttachmentAvatarToUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def self.up
    change_table :users do |t|
      t.attachment :avatar
    end
  end

  def self.down
    remove_attachment :users, :avatar
  end
end
```

Now add these paperclip methods in `User` Model:

```ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  # validations
  has_attached_file :avatar,
    styles: { big: "600x600#", medium: "300x300#", thumb: "100x100#" }

  validates_attachment_content_type :avatar,
    content_type: /\Aimage\/.*\z/
  # [...]
end
```

And we need to permit the `:avatar` parameter in `UsersController`:

```ruby
  #[...]
  def user_params
    params.require(:user).permit(:first_name, :last_name, :avatar)
  end
```

In development mode, images will be modified on your computer with ImageMagick, so you need to install it:

On Mac OS X:

```sh
$ brew install imagemagick
```

On Ubuntu:

```sh
sudo apt-get install imagemagick -y
```
