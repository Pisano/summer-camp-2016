# Specs

Define a function `maxOfThree()` that takes three numbers as arguments and
returns the largest of them. Use the if-else control flow in Javascript.
You must not make more than 2 comparisons.

**Example:**

```javascript
var largest = maxOfThree(5,1,10);
console.log(largest); // 10
```

# Test

When you think you are good, type `jasmine` in your terminal, all tests must be
green. Ideally you should not have any style offense.
