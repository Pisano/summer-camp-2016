Why do we need relational databases?

*For persistently storing the data. In an organized way.*

## Excel
We will start storing the data of developers of Pisano.

Let's say a developer has
  - `name`
  - `surname`
  - `city`

The simplest solution to store this data in an organized way would be

<img width="576" alt="developers_list" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1936287/16176217/4e10efd2-3611-11e6-8e34-3a0a512a8c03.png">


A city also have some other information itself. A city has
  - `country`
  - `population`

In order to keep this data, one might come up with a solution like this:

Mike is from Istanbul and Istanbul has a population of 14mio. The problem about this approach is Mike Soylu and 14.000.000 is not related directly but they are on the same row.
Therefore, when we try to get the info about Mike, we also get Turkey and the population of Istanbul.

There is a **relation** between developers and cities.
