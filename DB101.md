# Storing Data and Relational Databases

## Introduction
Why do we need databases?

Why do we need relational databases?

*For persistently storing the data. In an organized way.*

## Excel
We will start storing the data of developers of Pisano.

Let's say a developer has
  - `name`
  - `surname`
  - `city`

The simplest solution to store this data in an organized way would be

<img width="576" alt="developers_list" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1936287/16176217/4e10efd2-3611-11e6-8e34-3a0a512a8c03.png">


A city also have some other information itself. A city has
  - `country`
  - `population`

In order to keep this data, one might come up with a solution like this:

<img width="515" alt="screen shot 2016-06-22 at 15 37 29" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1936287/16266792/44c01fea-388f-11e6-8a4e-ece032f1c11b.png">

Mike is from Istanbul and Istanbul has a population of 14mio. The problem about this approach is Mike Soylu and 14.000.000 is not related directly but they are on the same row.
Therefore, when we try to get the info about Mike, we also get Turkey and the population of Istanbul.

How about we store the information related to the cities in a different sheet?

<img width="512" alt="cities" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1936287/16265566/b7828092-3888-11e6-940b-93cf65f70a70.png">

It seems more organized, right? At the moment, we have a list of cities and a list of developers, but in different sheets. The relation between these two sheets are the city names as both sheets have
that attribute `city_name`. Considering our small set of data, it seems perfectly fine. But as you might guess, this simple structure can still be confusing in some cases.

Let's create some ambiguity. One day, a developer named Fehmi joins the team and he is from Paris, France. Also, we update the list of cities by adding two other cities. First one is Paris, Arkansas, USA and
the second one is Paris, France. Now, you might guess the problem.

<img width="512" alt="screen shot 2016-06-22 at 16 50 35" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1936287/16269050/797c4876-3899-11e6-8411-b19679011fb7.png">
<img width="512" alt="screen shot 2016-06-22 at 16 54 34" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1936287/16269204/0a4eb8ac-389a-11e6-9d20-bd61be31a7ea.png">

After the new updates, we try to get the information about Fehmi's country. As we mentioned earlier, the relation between these two sheets made possible with `city_name` attribute and now it is confusing
because it may refer to more than one row! The solution is simple. We should use a relation that will not be confusing in any case. It should be independent of the data we insert here.

The solution that is adapted by many is that using a unique id to represent the relation. And in order to make sure that this relation is definite in any kind of data, we should generate the value that
we are going to use for referencing. Let's do this. Give a unique identifier to each city

<img width="513" alt="screen shot 2016-06-22 at 17 06 25" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1936287/16269647/e2271598-389b-11e6-9ac1-690434db7deb.png">

and update the developers list accordingly:

<img width="511" alt="screen shot 2016-06-22 at 17 07 44" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1936287/16269646/e220c15c-389b-11e6-9f3b-5c894bb99f7b.png">

To sum up our current relation, a developer can live only in one city but in a city, there might be one or more developers. This relation is called **one-to-many** relationship.

### One more step: Developers write code!

After registering our developers, we also want to register their language skills. We want to know their area of expertise. Now that we learned what a relation is, we can immediately say
there should be a relation between a developer and a language. Let's start with the list of languages:

<img width="510" alt="screen shot 2016-06-22 at 17 36 13" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1936287/16270690/dcb719a6-389f-11e6-8b00-0c5eeeb73abc.png">

Then, we want to register that Fabien knows `Ruby` and Ibrahim knows `Go` and `Javascript`

<img width="509" alt="screen shot 2016-06-22 at 18 19 27" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1936287/16272324/0cca54fe-38a6-11e6-8b83-56892367654f.png">

We saved the information about Fabien but as you can see we can not represent the information about Ibrahim knowing two languages. This problem occurs because the relation between a developer
and a city is different from the relation between a developer and a language. Why? Because a developer can live in more than one city but can know more than one language.

This relation is called many-to-many relation. A developer can know multiple languages and a language can be mastered by many developers. In order to represent this kind of relationship, we need another
sheet.

### TODO

## SHOW RELATION TYPES

- one-to-one
- one-to-many
- many-to-many

### Querying

- What is SQL?

Structured Query Language.

- Give me all you got about developers!


```sql
SELECT * FROM developers;
```

- Give first names of all developers!


```sql
SELECT first_name
FROM developers;
```

- Give me all city names which has a population more than 1mio


```sql
SELECT *
FROM cities
WHERE population > 1000000;
```


- Give me all city names which is in Turkey ordered by their population


```sql
SELECT *
FROM cities
WHERE country = 'Turkey'
ORDER BY population;
```

- No, I meant in reverse order!


```sql
SELECT *
FROM cities
WHERE country = 'Turkey'
ORDER BY population DESC;
```

- How many developers do we have?


```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM developers;
```
