# Specs

Write a method `fizz_buzz` which takes an integer, `number` as argument, and
return an array of `number` elements from 1 to `number`, but replacing some
elements according to those rules:

- If the number is divisible by `3`, then replace it by `'Fizz'`
- If the number is divisible by `5`, then replace it by `'Buzz'`
- If the number is divisible by both `3` and `5`, then replace it by `'FizzBuzz'`

Example:

```ruby
fizz_buzz(10)
# => [1, 2, 'Fizz', 4, 'Buzz', 'Fizz', 7, 8, 'Fizz', 10]
```

# Test

when you think you are good, type `rake` in your terminal, all tests must be green. Ideally you should not have any style offense.
